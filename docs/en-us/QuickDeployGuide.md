## Create a Telegram bot
Talk to [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) and request for a new bot with `/newbot` command. BotFather will give you a bot token seems like `123456:1234567890ABCDEFGabcdefg` after the new bot created.

Then, the PoCs belonging to each faction need to chat with [ID Bot](https://t.me/myidbot) or [get id](https://t.me/get_id_bot) bot. Both will reply the Telegram ID in number (like `Your Chat ID = 000000`).

## Deploy to Heroku
Click ‚ÄúDeploy to Heroku‚Äù button on [project homepage](https://github.com/Astrian/IFS-RSVP-Bot), then fill in all those information:

- `AIRTABLE_TOKEN`: Your Airtable API key.
- `BASE_ID`: The base ID belonged to the target base.
- `DOMAIN`ÔºöFill in the `App name` field first (at the top of the form), then, fill `https://<App name>.herokuapp.com` in this field. **Don't add `/` at the end of the URL.**
- `IFS_INFO`: Fill the JSON including your IFS information. 
- `RANDOM_ADDRESS`: Start with `/`, then input some random string fit to URL standard.
- `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`: The bot token given by BotFather.

::: tip I haven't Heroku account yet...
Don't worry. Heroku will redirect to sign-up page after you click the button, and you can create a Heroku account with it.
:::

The sample of `IFS_INFO`:

```json
[{"location":"Mojave","enlpoc":[123456,789012],"respoc":[345678,901234]}]
```

```json
[{"location":"El Capiton","enlpoc":[123456],"respoc":[789012]},{"location":"Yosemite","enlpoc":[345678],"respoc":[901234]}]
```

::: tip About the location field
IFS RSVP Bot supports multiple IFS events at the same time. The bot will identify different event by `location` field, and this field should be same as the **sheet** name (not the base name).
:::

Then, the PoCs can send `/start` command to the bot created. If the bot reply a welcome message, the config is all comleted. üéâ

## Next...
In the next part, we should import the RSVP list of First Saturday event.

## Foot note

1. The free service of Heroku has some restricitions, for example, limit running time in a period, 5 apps in your accounts (can be canceled with free credit card verification), etc. However, in theory, the free service is enough for bot running.
